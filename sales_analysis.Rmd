## Introduction

- Objective: Analyze the sales dataset to uncover key business insights.
- Tasks performed:
  - Cleaned and prepared the dataset.
  - Extracted useful date features.
  - Performed aggregation and summarization.
  - Created visualizations for better understanding.
  - Built a custom function for region-wise reports.
  - Used loops and conditions for additional insights.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv("sales_dataa.csv")

# Handle missing values
data$Units_Sold[is.na(data$Units_Sold)] <- mean(data$Units_Sold, na.rm = TRUE)
data$Unit_Price[is.na(data$Unit_Price)] <- mean(data$Unit_Price, na.rm = TRUE)

# Drop rows where Revenue is NA
data <- data[!is.na(data$Revenue), ]

# Convert date
data$Date <- ymd(data$Date)

# Add new columns
data$Year <- year(data$Date)
data$Month <- month(data$Date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)
data$Weekday <- wday(data$Date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)
```

---

## Analysis

```{r analysis}
# Month with highest revenue
rev_by_month <- aggregate(Revenue ~ Month, data, sum)
best_month <- rev_by_month$Month[which.max(rev_by_month$Revenue)]

# Day with lowest average units sold
avg_units_by_day <- aggregate(Units_Sold ~ Weekday, data, mean)
worst_day <- avg_units_by_day$Weekday[which.min(avg_units_by_day$Units_Sold)]

cat("Month with highest revenue:", best_month, "\n")
cat("Day with lowest average units sold:", worst_day, "\n")
```

---

##Loop & Condition Logic

```{r loop-logic}
avg_rev <- mean(data$Revenue)
data$Performance <- ifelse(data$Revenue > avg_rev, "High", "Low")

# Monthly revenue loop
for (m in unique(data$Month)) {
  total <- sum(data$Revenue[data$Month == m])
  cat("Month:", m, "- Total Revenue:", total, "\n")
}
```

---

## Custom Region Report Function

```{r custom-function}
region_report <- function(region_name) {
  sub <- data[data$Region == region_name, ]
  total_rev <- sum(sub$Revenue, na.rm = TRUE)
  top_product <- names(which.max(tapply(sub$Revenue, sub$Product, sum, na.rm = TRUE)))
  high_rev_days <- sub$Date[sub$Revenue > mean(data$Revenue, na.rm = TRUE)]

  cat(" Report for:", region_name, "\n")
  cat("Total Revenue:", total_rev, "\n")
  cat("Top-selling Product:", top_product, "\n")
  cat("High Revenue Days:\n")
  print(high_rev_days)
}
```

## Visualizations

```{r plots}
# Region vs Revenue
ggplot(data, aes(x = Region, y = Revenue)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = sum, fill = "skyblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Total Revenue by Region")


# Date vs Revenue Line Chart
ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = Revenue)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkgreen") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Revenue Over Time")

# Stacked Bar: Product vs Units Sold by Performance
ggplot(data, aes(x = Product, y = Units_Sold, fill = Performance)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Units Sold by Product and Performance")
```

##Conclusion

- Cleaned and enriched the sales dataset with date features.
- Found that `r best_month` had the highest revenue.
- Identified `r worst_day` as the weakest weekday for unit sales.
- Created reusable functions for regional insights.
- Visualizations showed strong patterns in product and regional performance.
